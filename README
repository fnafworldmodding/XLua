XLua is a powerful Lua-scripting extension to Clickteam's Multimedia Fusion 2.

An overview of XLua is available at http://www.fusionwiki.com/wiki/XLua

The structure of this repository as as follows:
- Ext-Dyngrid :: An example bridge module between XLua and the Dynamic Grid Object.  Uses the deprecated MMFI and object export model.
- XLua :: The core XLua extension.
- XLua-Java :: A Java-runtime version of the XLua extension.
- XLua-MMFI :: A loadable C Module for directly interfacing with MMF's internal state machine from Lua code.
- XLua-OpenGL :: A loadable C Module for using OpenGL from Lua code, based on LuaGL.
- XLua-Static :: A loadable C Module for statically-allocated arrays.
- XLua-Surface :: An incomplete helper extension for performinc CSurface drawing directly from Lua code.
- XSDK :: Support code for XLua-MMFI and bridge modules.

External Dependencies:

Most projects depend on either the official MMF SDK (referenced in projects as vendor/SDK/current), or rSDK.
These dependencies can be obtained from the Extension Development forum on Clickteam's message board.

NOTE for the sake of me, if you encountered linking errors with luajit, you compiled it with the incorrect vs tools, you must use VS2015 x86 Native Tools Command Prompt and make sure that xlua (extension) platform tools is set to "Visual Studio 2015 - Windows XP (v140_xp)"
otherwise you will spent your whole day pointlessly
